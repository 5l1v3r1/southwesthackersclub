SouthWest Hackers Club or SWHC is a professional networking club specifically for young professionals in the cybersecurity industry in the SouthWest of the UK.

We noticed that there were very few good opportunities to network with other penetration testers, hackers and consultants in this part of the UK. For a long time many of the meetup opportunities have been with people that are not in the offensive security industry, have a low skill level or generally don't share the same experiences as us.

We are changing this. 

At SouthWest Hackers Club, we aim to provide a platform to network young professionals in South West area, specifically Plymouth and Bristol, and at events such as Bsides Bristol.

If you're in your 20's and you're working as an offensive security professional in the South West area, and would like to meet like-minded, local people, join us on [our Discord](https://discord.gg/XJ8wdXS)

To gain access you must prove you're in the South West in some capacity, and have the ability to travel to either Bristol or Plymouth. 

On this site we will not particularly publish articles or material, and our larger community [0x00sec](https://0x00sec.org/) will be the home of content we produce.

SWHC is simply a way for us to get to know people in our local area, the Twitter account, this website and the Discord are simply a place to make this happen and coordinate meetups.

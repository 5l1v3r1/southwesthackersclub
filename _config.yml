  SouthWest Hackers Club is a meetup and professional networking club
  created for young cybersecurity professionals in the SouthWest of England.
  We're primarily based out of Plymouth and Bristol, and started this place 
  because we found that there are very few good opportunities to meet people 
  with the same interests and skillsets.
